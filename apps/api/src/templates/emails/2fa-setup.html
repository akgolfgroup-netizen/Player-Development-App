<h1>Two-Factor Authentication Enabled 🛡️</h1>

<p>Hi {{firstName}},</p>

<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) has been successfully enabled for your IUP Golf Academy account.</p>

<div class="highlight-box" style="background: #ecfdf5; border-left-color: #10b981;">
  <p style="margin: 0; color: #065f46;">
    <strong>✓ Your account is now more secure!</strong>
  </p>
  <p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; color: #065f46;">
    From now on, you'll need both your password and a verification code from your authenticator app to sign in.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Your Backup Codes</h2>

<p>Save these backup codes in a safe place. You can use them to access your account if you lose access to your authenticator app:</p>

<div class="card">
  {{#each backupCodes}}
  <div style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 16px; padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">
    {{this}}
  </div>
  {{/each}}
</div>

<p style="font-size: 14px; color: #6b7280;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Each backup code can only be used once. Store them securely and don't share them with anyone.
</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>The next time you sign in, you'll be prompted to enter a 6-digit code from your authenticator app after entering your password.</p>

<h2>Need to Disable 2FA?</h2>

<p>You can disable two-factor authentication anytime from your account settings. You'll need your current password to make this change.</p>
