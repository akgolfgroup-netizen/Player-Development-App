### Tournament Categorization Framework

Every tournament is categorized into one of three types based on **purpose and priority**:

**R - RESULTAT** (Result)

- Full preparation and tapering
- 4-6 per season

**U - UTVIKLING** (Development)
- Skill testing and experience building
- Moderate preparation
- 8-12 per season

**T - TRENING** (Training)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Over-Scheduling
❌ **Wrong**: 30+ tournaments per season
✅ **Right**: 18-24 tournaments with recovery weeks

### All RESULTAT Mentality
❌ **Wrong**: Treating every tournament as "must-win"
✅ **Right**: Strategic categorization based on goals

### No Tapering
❌ **Wrong**: Training hard week of major championship
✅ **Right**: Planned taper for RESULTAT events

### Result-Only Goals
❌ **Wrong**: "Must finish top 3"
✅ **Right**: "Execute process, finish in top 3 is outcome"

### Ignoring Recovery
❌ **Wrong**: Tournament every single weekend
✅ **Right**: Recovery weeks between heavy blocks

### Wrong Category Tournaments
❌ **Wrong**: Low-level events marked as RESULTAT
✅ **Right**: RESULTAT reserved for truly important events

## Season Planning Workflow

### Step 1: Identify All Available Tournaments
- Research tour calendars
- Club events
- Regional events
- National events
- International events

### Step 2: Categorize Each Tournament
Ask three questions:
1. **Impact**: Does this tournament affect ranking/qualification/goals?
2. **Timing**: When in season? (Early = more TRENING, Peak = RESULTAT)
3. **Development**: What skills can be tested/developed?

### Step 3: Apply RUT Labels
- Mark 4-6 as RESULTAT
- Mark 8-12 as UTVIKLING
- Mark 6-10 as TRENING

### Step 4: Schedule in PERIODISERING
- Enter all tournaments in Notion TURNERINGER database
- Link to appropriate weeks in PERIODISERING
- Mark taper weeks for RESULTAT events

### Step 5: Validate Schedule
- Check total count (18-28 ideal)
- Ensure recovery weeks
- Balance throughout Turneringsperiode
- Avoid 3+ consecutive weekends (fatigue risk)

### Step 6: Communicate with Player/Parents
- Review tournament calendar
- Explain RUT categories
- Set expectations for each tournament
- Confirm logistics (travel, costs)
