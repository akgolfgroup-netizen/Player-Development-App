## Overview

Benchmark testing occurs **every 3rd week** (weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42) to track player progression and identify breaking points.

---

## Pre-Benchmark Preparation (1 Week Before)

### Coach Checklist
- [ ] Verify benchmark week in player's PERIODISERING
- [ ] Review player's current category and requirements
- [ ] Review previous benchmark results
- [ ] Note current breaking points from player profile
- [ ] Prepare testing equipment:
  - [ ] Launch monitor (Trackman/GC Quad)
  - [ ] Video recording devices (2 angles)
  - [ ] Measuring tape
  - [ ] Stopwatch/timer
  - [ ] Score sheets
  - [ ] Physical testing equipment (weights, medicine ball, etc.)

### Player Notification
- [ ] Send notification 7 days before
- [ ] Explain which tests will be conducted
- [ ] Provide preparation guidelines:
  - Good night's sleep
  - Proper nutrition
  - Light warmup day before
  - Arrive 30 min early for warmup

## Test Selection Strategy

### Minimum Requirements
- **4-7 tests minimum** per benchmark
- Must include at least **1 test from each major category** when possible:
  - Golf Shots (1-7)
  - Teknikk (8-11)
  - Fysisk (12-14)

### Selection Criteria

**Focus on breaking points**:
If player has "Putting under press" as breaking point → Include Test 15

**Test category requirements**:
Always test areas needed for next category progression

**Rotate through all 14 tests**:
Over 4 benchmarks (12 weeks), player should complete all 14 tests minimum once

## Individual Test Protocols

### TEST 1: Driver Avstand (Carry)
**Equipment**: Launch monitor, driver
**Protocol**:
1. Player hits 6 drives
2. Discard highest and lowest
3. Average remaining 4 drives
4. Record carry distance in meters

**Conditions**:
- Flat lie
- No wind or adjust for wind
- Standard range balls or premium balls
- Record temperature

**Recording**:
```
Shot 1: ___ m
Shot 2: ___ m
Shot 3: ___ m (discard if highest/lowest)
Shot 4: ___ m
Shot 5: ___ m (discard if highest/lowest)
Shot 6: ___ m

Average: ___ m
```

---

### TEST 4: Wedge PEI (Precision Efficiency Index)
**Equipment**: Launch monitor or measuring tape, wedges
**Protocol**:
1. Set target at player's ideal approach distance for category
   - Cat A-B: 140m
   - Cat C-D: 120m
   - Cat E-F: 100m
   - Cat G-K: 80m
2. Player hits 6 shots to target
3. Measure distance from hole/flag for each
4. Calculate average distance from target
5. PEI = (Avg distance from target) / (Ideal approach distance)

**Recording**:
```
Ideal approach distance: ___ m
Shot 1 distance from target: ___ m
Shot 2 distance from target: ___ m
Shot 3 distance from target: ___ m
Shot 4 distance from target: ___ m
Shot 5 distance from target: ___ m
Shot 6 distance from target: ___ m

Average distance: ___ m
PEI = ___ / ___ = ___
```

### TEST 12: Benkpress 1RM
**Equipment**: Barbell, plates, spotter
**Safety**: ALWAYS use spotter, proper warmup

**Protocol**:
1. Warmup:
   - Bar only × 10 reps
   - 50% estimated 1RM × 5 reps
   - 70% estimated 1RM × 3 reps
   - 85% estimated 1RM × 1 rep
2. Attempt 1RM:
   - Start at 90% estimated
   - Increase 2.5-5kg per attempt
   - Rest 3-5 min between attempts
   - Max 3-4 attempts at 1RM

**Form requirements**:
- Bar touches chest
- Full lockout
- No bounce
- Controlled descent

**Recording**:
```
Estimated 1RM: ___ kg
Attempt 1: ___ kg [✓/✗]
Attempt 2: ___ kg [✓/✗]
Attempt 3: ___ kg [✓/✗]

1RM Result: ___ kg
```

---

### TEST 15: Pressure Putting
**Equipment**: 10 balls, putter, 2m marker
**Protocol**:
1. Set up 10 putts at 2 meters
2. Player must make ALL 10 consecutively
3. If miss → reset to 0
4. Record number of successful streaks and attempts
5. Calculate success rate vs. baseline (practice putts)

**Baseline (no pressure)**:
- 10 putts at 2m, record make %

**Pressure test**:
- Elimination format
- Track number of attempts needed
- Track longest streak

**Recording**:
```
Baseline (no pressure): ___/10 = ___%

Pressure test:
Attempt 1: Made ___ before miss
Attempt 2: Made ___ before miss
Attempt 3: Made ___ before miss
...

Best streak: ___/10
Total attempts needed: ___
Pressure success rate: ___%
```

## Post-Test Processing

### Immediate (Same Day)
1. **Enter all results into TESTER database**
   - Link to player
   - Enter result, requirement, category
   - Mark Godkjent (checkbox) if met requirement

2. **Create BENCHMARKING entry**
   - Link all test results
   - Note conditions
   - Initial observations

### Within 3 Days
3. **Analyze results**
   - Compare to category requirements
   - Identify passing tests (Godkjent = ✓)
   - Identify failing tests → breaking points
   - Compare to previous benchmark
   - Calculate improvement rates

4. **Write summary**
   - Strengths (tests passed with margin)
   - Weaknesses (tests failed or barely passed)
   - Breaking points (significant gaps)
   - Trends (improving/declining/stable)

5. **Plan adjustments**
   - Update breaking points in player profile
   - Modify next 3 weeks training focus
   - Assign corrective exercises
   - Update PERIODISERING if major changes needed

6. **Generate report**
   - PDF summary for player/parent
   - Include:
     - All test results with category requirements
     - Visual charts showing progression
     - Breaking points explanation
     - Focus areas for next 3 weeks
     - Next benchmark date

7. **Schedule next benchmark**
   - Set date in PERIODISERING
   - Add to BENCHMARKING as "Neste benchmark"

## Category Progression Assessment

### Evaluate if player is ready for category upgrade

**Criteria** (ALL must be met):
1. **Consistent score** (3 months in target range)
2. **Physical tests** (2 of 3 passed)
3. **Golf tests** (4 of 7 passed)
4. **Mental readiness** (coach assessment)

### Status Options
- **Klar for opprykk**: All criteria met, recommend upgrade
- **På riktig vei**: Progressing well, 1-2 criteria remaining
- **Plateau**: Needs training adjustment, not progressing
- **Bekymringsfull trend**: Declining results, needs intervention
- **Stabil i kategori**: Maintaining category, appropriate level

## FAQ

**Q: What if weather prevents outdoor testing?**
A: Postpone golf shot tests, conduct indoor tests (physical, mental, technique with monitor)

**Q: Player is sick on benchmark week?**
A: Reschedule to following week, adjust next benchmark accordingly

**Q: Player fails all tests?**
A: Consider category downgrade, major training intervention, check for external factors (injury, stress, etc.)

**Q: Player passes all tests easily?**
A: Consider category upgrade evaluation, increase training intensity

**Q: How to handle borderline results?**
A: If within 5% of requirement, consider "working towards" vs. clear pass/fail
