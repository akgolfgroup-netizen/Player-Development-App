## Development Phases

Players progress through phases:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  E - Establish    │ Build fundamentals      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  G - Grow         │ Develop consistency     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  S - Strengthen   │ Refine and optimize     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  T - Tournament   │ Peak for competition    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Training Plan Generation

Training plans are generated based on:

1. Current category scores
2. Target handicap
3. Available training time
4. Competition schedule
5. Physical capabilities

The algorithm prioritizes:
- Weakest categories with highest improvement potential
- Balance across all aspects
- Phase-appropriate focus
